# What's Next?

Use the Vercel-hosted app [here](https://whats-next-five.vercel.app).

## General Description
*Streamline your streaming.* Do you ever get a recommendation from a friend about a new show to watch, but then can't recall the recommendation a month later? Do you vaguely remember watching a really good British crime show like 3 years ago, but can't remember the show's title or streaming service? Do you want to quickly find a fun comedy, available on Netflix, that a friend watched and enjoyed sometime in the last month? If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, then <b>What's Next?</b> is for you!

## Summary
Whenever a friend mentions a show they just loved... or you read a review of a new show online... or you scroll past a show that looks cool on your way to finding the show you meant to watch - don't forget about that new show!

Open up <b>What's Next?</b>, and add the new show to your Watch List.

If you want, add the streaming service the show is available on, the genre, and where the show "ranks" in your priority queue - is it the next thing on your list? Or something to turn on in a few months once you've finished everything else?

Once you've finished a show, move it <i>out</i> of your Watch List and <i>into</i> your Watched Log. And when you do, you have the option to add a rating.

Now, when a friend asks you about that kinda weird but very cool SciFi show you watched on HBO Max a couple years ago, you know just where to look to find it!

Create a network of friends who use the app, and easily view their profiles.

You can also generate an easily-shareable link so that anyone - even people without accounts - can view your profile.
